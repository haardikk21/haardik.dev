      'Built LedgerLocker - an extensible protocol to use yield from deposits in DeFi as a revenue model for any project. In addition to the protocol, we developed a Proof of Concept dApp that used LedgerLocker that was an AirBnB-style rental platform where you pay for the rental by depositing collateral into LedgerLocker with the yield going to the owner of the property until the rental fee is paid off. The project won bounty prizes from Infura, Fortmatic, The Graph, and Pepo, and also got a special shoutout from Danny Ryan (Ethereum Foundation) during the closing ceremony.',
