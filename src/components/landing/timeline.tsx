I wrote a specification for using EIP-712 signatures as a scheme for JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. I also authored CAIP-122, the Sign in with X standard to create a chain-agnostic blockchain authentication mechanism, and CAIP-74, the Chain Agnostic Capability Object (CACAO) standard to use CAIP-74 messages as an object capability method for delegating access to resources to other identities in a self-sovereign manner. I built proofs of concept for CACAO on Ethereum and Solana, both of which are widely in use today - most popularly within the Gitcoin Passport application. Apart from the standards work, I contributed to the Ceramic Network node (js-ceramic), the DID library packages (js-did), and Rebase (rebase-xyz).',
